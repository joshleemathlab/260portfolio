    <h2>About</h2>
       <p>My name is Joshua J. Lee. I was born in Sandy, UT, on January 1st, 1995. When I was 2 years old, our family moved to Korea, where I went to school at an international school. I grew up learning Korean at home and English naturally at school, and between ages 12 and 18, I took classes and learned Spanish. After graduating in 2013 from the same international school, I attended two semesters at Brigham Young University as a pre-business major.</p>
       <p>In my second semester at BYU, I received an ecclesiastical service call, otherwise known as a mission call to members of the LDS church, to Concepcion, Chile, specifically serving in the "Chile Concepcion South Mission". I lived at and served as an LDS missionary from September, 2014, to June, 2016. Returning to BYU, I decided to study computer engineering because my older brother had graduated in that field. After taking engineering classes, I decided to switch to computer science, as the subjects intrigued me more. </p>

       <p>Growing up, I always had an intrigue and passion for photography. My dad picked up photography as a young man, and passed his knowledge onto me as well as buying me a camera before I went to South Africa for a school trip in 2009. After discovering that I had a talent in photography, I dabbled in it in the following years and tinkered with videography.</p>
       <p>It wasn't until late 2016 when I realized that two of my greatest passions in this world were photography and videography. Having left my older cameras in Korea before moving to the States in 2013, I only had a recently purchased GoPro Hero 5 Black, which I used to make videos whenever I went out on adventures with my friends. Having made videos of several hikes and time on the snow, I decided in the summer of 2017 to take my talents a step further. I purchased a Canon 80D and started taking photos and videos as a job.</p>
       <p>Just starting out, I was fortunate enough to have friends who were getting married at that time have me be the videographer for their weddings, which gave me a lot of experience and learning at several LDS temples, including the Salt Lake City, Sacramento, and Washington D.C. temples. I had friends who loved having their pictures taken, and I started an instagram account with the content I generated from these activities.</p>
       <p>The busier I get in school, the more I realize how stress relieving photography and videography are. I hope to continue in these hobbies and talents as I get hired more and more for weddings, product shoots, and travel/marketing endeavours.
